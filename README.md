# lyricalSong
about my project, so it needs timing about the selection of 
playing the song and showing the lyrics, 
if you're gonna play it without showing the lyrics it can 
P = Play, S = Stop, L = Show Lyrics, R = Reset, Q = Quit.
so yes as I've said earlier it needs to select P = Play, and L = Show Lyrics,
at the same time so that it can run the lyrics smoothly.
